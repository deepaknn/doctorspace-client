## Registry for Medical Practitioners and Healthcare Providers 

## Overview
This project aims to create a comprehensive registry of medical professionals by collecting their details from an external API and storing them in a database. This registry serves as a valuable resource for healthcare organizations, regulatory bodies, and individuals seeking information about medical practitioners.

## Key Components

1. **Authentication and Authorization:**  
   - Users can authenticate themselves using username and password and obtain an authentication token.
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used for token-based authentication, and a refresh token mechanism is implemented for token renewal.

2. **Data Loading and Fetching:**  
   - The application provides endpoints to load and fetch medical professional data.
   - Medical professional details are fetched from an external API using RESTful calls.
   - Data loading and fetching operations are performed asynchronously to optimize performance and scalability.

3. **Data Persistence:**  
   - Medical professional data is stored in a relational database using JPA (Java Persistence API) entities.
   - Data loading operations insert new records into the database, while data fetching operations update existing records with fresh information.

4. **Scheduled Tasks:**  
   - Scheduled tasks periodically fetch updated data for medical professionals from the external API.
   - These tasks ensure that the registry remains up-to-date with the latest information about medical practitioners.

## Project Workflow

1. **User Authentication:**  
   - Users authenticate themselves using the `/authenticate/token` endpoint by providing their credentials.
   - Upon successful authentication, users receive an authentication token and a refresh token.

2. **Data Loading:**  
   - Authorized users can upload batches of medical professional data using the `/load/data` endpoint.
   - The application processes these requests asynchronously, inserting the provided data into the database.

3. **Data Fetching:**  
   - Scheduled tasks periodically fetch updated data for medical professionals from the external API.
   - The fetched data is processed asynchronously and updated in the database to ensure accuracy and completeness.

## Benefits

- **Comprehensive Registry:** The application facilitates the creation of a comprehensive registry of medical professionals, consolidating information from multiple sources.
- **Timely Updates:** Scheduled tasks ensure that the registry is regularly updated with the latest information, maintaining its relevance and reliability.
- **Efficient Data Handling:** Asynchronous processing and parallel execution of tasks optimize the application's performance and scalability.
- **Secure Access:** Token-based authentication and authorization mechanisms ensure secure access to the application's functionalities.

## Future Enhancements

- **Search and Filtering:** Implement search and filtering functionalities to allow users to query the registry based on various criteria.
- **Data Enrichment:** Integrate additional sources of information to enrich the medical professional data and provide more comprehensive profiles.
- **User Management:** Enhance user management capabilities to support role-based access control and user-specific preferences.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Develop reporting and analytics features to analyze trends and patterns in the medical professional data.
